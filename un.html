<p style="font-size:16px;color:black;font-family:Arial Verdana;">
 Seeing that most people
around the country dont get to have fresh meat at their convenience we 
decided to start the company to solve the misfortune.We are a company that is made up of talented and hardworking members whose 
  passion is in serving the community to thier best of ability.
  We are a young company that is determined to see change in the 
  meat industry in the country and the whole buying and selling process involved in it.
  We believe that money not circulate within one county but within all counties of the contry.
  People in different counties have got needs that can be fullfilled by people in different countries. All is needed is a means of connecting them so that both can benefit and grow.
